<p>Hi, I'm Josh. In May 2019, I graduated from Yale University, where I studied Computer Science & Psychology. Now, I work as a full-stack software engineer at
<a href="https://spincar.com">SpinCar</a>. Outside of work, I love music, I like to write little programs to automate simple tasks, and I like to play video games, watch sports (go Isles!) and exercise.
</p>

<p>
Back in college (ahh!), I played club squash, volunteered at the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen, and co-founded and treasurer'd (?) Yale Donate Life,
an organ-donation-awareness organization.
