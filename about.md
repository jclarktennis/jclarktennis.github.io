<p>Hi, I'm Josh and I'm a senior at Yale University studying Computer Science and Psychology. On campus
I play club squash, volunteer at the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen, and I am the co-founder and treasurer of Yale Donate Life,
an organ donation awareness organization.</p>
<p>For fun, I like to watch sports (especially hockey -- go Isles!), exercise, spend time with my friends,
work on projects and puzzles, and listen to music. I'm a big fan of music festivals and live music, especially EDM.</p>

## Skills
### Programming Languages
+ <p> <details><summary>Python</summary> <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Python experience goes back to the beginning of my programming career. From the summer of 2013 to the fall of 2014, I worked at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, writing code for them in Python. I spent a few months writing a program that took as input a series of sequential images and produced as output a movie of those images put together. I spent the rest of my time at Regeneron writing an application that took stacks of micron-thin 3D images and allowed the user to view them together at any angle. This involved learning about polar coordinates and some basic linear algebra on my own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school got out in the spring of 2017, I wrote a program called <a href="https://github.com/jkclark/Lyrics-Always">Lyrics Always</a> that you can read about <a href="">ADD PROJECT LINK HERE</a>. At this point I dabbled with web scraping and <b>BeautifulSoup</b>.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, I have used Python in the aritificial intelligence courses I've taken and taught (TA'd) at Yale. In May 2018, I used Python in conjunction with <b>TensorFlow</b> to write a <a href="https://github.com/jkclark/Baseball-Neural-Net">neural network</a> to predict baseball games. You can read more about that project <a href="">ADD PROJECT LINK HERE</a>. </p> </details> </p>
+ <p> <details><summary>Golang</summary> <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience with Golang goes only as far back as the summer of 2018. At El Toro IP Targeting in Louisville, KY, I helped write a program to control an array of TVs using a Golang web server. All of the TV's run a Go-controlled client, each of which interact with the main "hub," a Go server. The hub controls what each TV is displaying (either a URL, a Youtube video, a picture, or Kibana/Graphana). These screens are up on the front wall of the El Toro headquarters, and our program is still in use today.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the TV project, I did work translating programs that interact with an arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_platform">DSP</a> from Python to Go. I enjoyed doing this work because I got to experience first-hand the strengths and weaknesses of each language. Definitely an interesting way to learn another language, especially since I had prior Python experience. </p> </details> </p>
+ <p> <details><summary>Javascript</summary> <p>
I am relatively new to Javascript, only getting started during the summer of 2018. To accompany the aforementioned Go TV controller, I wrote a UI in Javascript using <b>React</b>. It was very rewarding to think of a feature for the UI, implement it, and see it work with the TVs, which made this project the most fun project to work on during the summer. </p> </details> </p>
+ <p> <details><summary>Java</summary> <p>
It's been a little while since I wrote anything in Java. I took AP Computer Science in high school, which was taught in Java. During spring break of my junior year of high school, I wrote a program in Java to solve Sudoku puzzles. It was pretty good, but some puzzles in the "Hard" or "Very Hard" category would stump it. Unfortunately this was before my introduction to the world of version control, so I don't have the program anymore <br> (R.I.P code ⚰️). </p> </details> </p>
+ <p> <details><summary>C</summary> <p>
My C experience does not extend outside of school. The main computer science courses at Yale are taught in C. It would take a lot for me to choose to write in C over another language voluntarily. </p> </details> </p>
