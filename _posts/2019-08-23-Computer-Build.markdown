**Note:** This article is a work-in-progress.

**Warning:** Some parts of this post have far more detail than they probably
need to. Read at your own risk.

## Background
Once I graduated from high school and
started college, I basically stopped playing video games. Going to school and
living with my friends took over, and having a gaming computer at school just
didn't seem worth the effort. Now that I've graduated from college and moved
into my own apartment, I have more time, more freedom, more money, and fewer
social interactions on a day-to-day basis. I decided that I could finally get
back into video games, and I could do it in style.

## Research
Many of my friends have told me about their computer-building
adventures, all of them claiming it's fun, not too hard, and totally worth the
money-for-work trade off (if you build it yourself, you don't have to pay
someone else to do it for you). They weren't wrong, but they led me to believe
that it would be easier and go more smoothly than it did, but more on that
later.

I needed to decide on what parts to buy for my computer. Here are the three
goals I had in mind when choosing the parts:
1. Buy parts that are all compatible with each other, no screw-ups
2. Be able to play games in >100 FPS and 1440p
3. Be able to see the inside of the computer, and (if possible) have it look good

My research mainly consisted of looking up "best X for gaming computers" and
using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) to look at other people's
builds and to sort parts based on various features. In the end, I think I relied
mainly on others' reviews, advice,

To make sure that my goal of part-compatibility was accomplished, I posted on
[/r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc), asking more-experienced people
to review the list of parts that I had come up with. They confirmed that there
were no compatibility issues, as far as they could tell (they were correct), and
that the resulting machine would be a beast – this got my hopes up for goal #2.

## Final parts list
Here is the list of parts that I settled on:

CPU: **AMD Ryzen 7 2700x**
- Why I settled on AMD instead of Intel, I don't really know. I read a lot of
	articles about Intel vs. AMD, and it seemed like the main difference was that
	AMD chips were better at multitasking, whereas Intel chips were better at
	single-threaded tasks. The Ryzen 2700x appealed to me on an aesthetic level,
	it was on sale for Amazon Prime Day, and I saw a 
	[Linus Tech Tips video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoKPCCYvByo) which
	concluded that it was really just as good as whatever the equivalent Intel
	chip is, so I just went for it.

CPU Cooler: **Corsair H100i RGB Platinum SE**
- I saw a build on pcpartpicker.com that I thought looked good that used this
	cooler, so I got it. I did a little research about different coolers, but in
	the end I think I really liked it for the colors.

Motherboard: **ASRock B450M Steel Legend**
- Honestly, none of the motherboards online really piqued my interest. They were
	all pretty meh. There doesn't seem to be one extremely reputable company that
	has everything down. Every other component had at least one candidate that
	made me think to myself "If I can't find anything else, this will work." There
	were no motherboards like that. This one seemed pretty solid according to the
	reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, which, combined with being a microATX board,
	made me pick it over other boards.

Memory: **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro**
- I picked the RAM last, which made this the easiest choice. They were Corsair
	(so they went with my cpu cooler, case, and power supply), they were white,
	and they looked amazing, both on and off. The reviews were also stellar, so
	I jumped on these right away.

Storage: **Samsung 860 EVO SSD 1TB**
- I didn't do too much looking for an SSD. This one was recommended all over the
	place, had great reviews, and wasn't over-the-top expensive. Easy pick.

Video Card: **EVGA GeForce RTX 2080**
- I spent a lot of time deciding what graphics card to get. At one point, I was
	considering getting the RTX 2080 Ti, which is nearly twice as expensive as this one.
	Looking back on it, I am very happy with the card I settled on, as I basically
	don't see how it could perform better than it does, but I'll disucss that in
	more detail in a later section. Anyway, this was the part of the build where
	I decided I wanted my computer to shine unlike any other computer I'd owned
	before. I settled on this card mainly because of the price and the reviews. It
	seemed that the reviews of every graphics card were littered with "Never
	trusting X company again" and "Had to RMA right away," but I figured that was
	a chance I'd need to take no matter what card I bought.

Case: **Corsair Crystal Series 280x**
- This case would accomplish part of one of my goals (be able to see inside the
	computer), it looked really nice, and it was relatively small (I don't have
	much space in my small NYC apartment). My friend Sam has an older version of
	the same case, and gave it a glowing recommendation. All of this was enough to
	make me jump on it.

Power Supply: **Corsair RMx Series RM750x**
- Basically, this PSU looked nice, was fully modular, wasn't overpriced, and had
	good reviews. I stopped looking after I came across this PSU.

## The build
As soon as I got the last part delivered in the mail, I got to building. Looking
back, I should have done much more research about how to *actually build*
a computer. It wasn't a total disaster, but it probably would have gone much
more smoothly if I had watched a person or two complete a build on YouTube.

After I got home from work, I googled "what order to build a PC." I quickly
skimmed through several articles, hoping to get started right away. One build
suggested that I start by putting the PSU in first, since it's separate from
everything else and it's relatively simple. That was good advice. It was
satisfying to start with something easy, it went in there with no trouble, and
gave me a confidence boost for what was to come. Unfortuntely, not everything
else went so smoothly.

Next, I put the motherboard in the case. I had heard about how fragile the
motherboard can be, so I bought an electrostatic discharge bracelet, which
supposedly protects against frying your parts. I used it, but I'm not sure that
it was actually doing anything. I ended up having to put in and take out the
motherboard several times, but it never got fried, so maybe the bracelet was
working. Initially, it wasn't clear to me where I was supposed to screw the
motherboard in, but eventually I figured it out. The motherboard was easily the
most complicated part of the build – which makes sense as it connects every
piece of your build together.

A lot of the process of building the computer involved goolging stuff about my
specific parts. Everybody online answers questions about motherboards with some
version of "did you read the manual?", which isn't a bad question, but you might as
well answer the question, because it's likely someone else has the same question
who *has* read the manual.

Anyway, after I got the motherboard into the case, I clicked the I/O shield into
place. Another easy win amid the chaos. Next, I went to install the CPU. I saw
on YouTube that you're supposed to gently drop it in and basically do nothing else. 
That went fine, but I for some reason I believed that it hadn't gone in
properly, so I removed it and ended up accidentally getting my finger in the
thermal paste. I was kind of concerned that I would need to pause the build
until I got more thermal paste to reapply. The internet reassured me that it
was fine, but if temperatures were higher than normal when the computer was
running that I might need to put more on. It turned out just fine.

Next was the CPU cooler. This part turned out to be one of the more problematic
sections of the build. First off, there were several parts to install. There
were two fans to screw into the radiator, then the radiator-fan combo into the
case, and finally the water block/pump (not sure which it was, might be both?)
onto the CPU. I installed the fans on the inside of the case blowing into the
radiator and out of the case, instead of on the outside of the case blowing into
the radiator and into the case, as the instructions specified. I only realized
this afterwards, but it seems not to have had an impact – or, at least, not
a significantly negative one.

The real problem with the cooler came up when I tried to install the water
block/pump on the CPU. When installing the cooler onto an AMD CPU/motherboard,
you need to hook the water block/pump onto the board. This is most easily done
by unscrewing the parts on the motherboard, raising them, hooking the block on,
and screwing the mobo parts back in. I didn't realize that you could unscrew the
parts on the mobo, so I needed to apply significant force to get the block on
both hooks. **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT DOING THIS.** I was pushing my entire body
down onto the block. I think I got very lucky because nothing was broken, but
I regretted this immediately after doing it. I really wanted everything to
work, so I think I was a little frustrated and lost in the moment. In general,
*if something isn't working by doing it gently, it's probably not supposed to
work like that.* Don't make the same mistake I did (even though it seems to have 
worked out for me). Read about your parts in detail, watch videos, make sure you
know what you're doing.

Next came the SSD. Really straightfoward. There was a slot in the case where
I just clicked it into place. All that was left for it was to wire it in. Piece
of cake.

After that was all done came the hardest remaining part of the build – installing
the GPU. You might think that it would be really easy to install the GPU; on
paper, it is easy. There are PCI slots that have covers on them. You
remove one of the covers (my GPU was two covers wide so I needed to remove two 
of them), slide the card into the now-free PCI slots, into the PCIe slots on the
motherboard, and boom, you're done. Well, almost. You're also supposed to screw
the graphics card into place, since it's going to be resting horizontally in
your case. Gravity will bear down on the card, and the screws will do most of
the work of keeping it upright. My case did not come with screws. My card did
not come with screws. This is where I started to panic (again, panicking is
never the answer). My case had holes that lined up exactly with holes on the
GPU. I was convinced screws were supposed to go there. Everybody on the internet
agreed. My friend Sam, however, believed that my case uses a clamping system to
keep the card upright. The PCI part of my GPU goes into the PCI slots and is
clamped down by something on my case. This is how it's sitting in my computer
today.

I'll admit I really started to freak out at this point. I was starting to think
that I wasn't cut out for building a computer, and that it would never work.
I think I had this expectation in my mind about how long it should take me, and
that the problems I was facing were so simple that they reflected an overall
incompetence that would block me from successfully putting the computer
together. I knew deep down that I shouldn't have freaked out, and that basically
never does you any good. I learned from this experience that a deep breath and
willingness to try can get you to where you want to be.

Once the GPU was in place, all I had to do was click the RAM sticks into place,
(which went smoothly) and then wire everything up. I was worried that the wiring
was going to be difficult, but it was actually quite simple. The wires don't
really fit into places where they don't belong. This makes it really easy to
connect everything up. The harder part is connecting everything in a way that
makes it look nice from the outside. At some point I'll post a picture to show
you what it looks like, but I don't think it looks too bad.

Once all the hardware was in place, it was time to finally press the power button.
I clicked it... and it all lit up and started whirring! I was really happy about that.
I had read many reviews online that getting a DOA part wasn't uncommon, but so
it was a big relief when it all turned on. The next part – installing Windows
– I thought would be a walk in the park. Boy, was I wrong.

## The OS nightmare
My initial understanding of installing Windows was that you could take any flashdrive,
put the Windows ISO on it, plug it into your machine, and bam, you're done. That *is*
case, but there are a lot of ways that you can screw that up.

The real source of all of my issues during this part of the process was that I don't have
a Windows machine. My coworker actually offered me a flashdrive that already
had a Windows installation on it  (created from his Windows machine). I took it, but then
gave it back for some reason because I thought I could make one myself with no problem.
How foolish! Why didn't I just keep it until I was done with the whole process? Who knows.
Just gotta try to learn a lesson from it.

I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO onto my Mac, but then found out that my flashdrive wasn't
formatted correctly. I thought I was going to have to buy a differently-formatted flashdrive,
but macOS has a tool to reformat them. I got the ISO onto my flashdrive (or so I thought), but an
error occurred while installing it onto my new computer. MacOS must have corrupted something while
copying all the files over. 

I thought I found a solution to this problem, too. There is a tool called [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/)
that supposedly can create bootable USB drives "cleanly" (I don't actually know what it does
specifically). Many people claimed to have success using this tool on macOS, but it didn't work
for me. The same error came up during the installation process on my new computer.
I found a Stack Exchange answer somewhere (can't find it now) that claimed this solution
does not work on macOS 10.14 Mojave. Brutal.

My next idea was to find a Windows machine. I didn't want to wait, though; I installed Parallels
Desktop on my Mac, which could run Windows. I then downloaded the Windows program that
creates bootable USB drives through the virtual machine, and bam! It was working!

This whole process took about two days, and it was really frustrating. I don't know
what I could have done to make it take less time. I think I just had to go through
that whole process the way I did. Whatever. Now I know: Use Windows to create
bootable USB Windows installations.

## Peripherals
In order to complete the setup, I had to get some additional equipment:

Monitor: **ASUS ROG Swift PG278QR**
- This monitor has a 165Hz refresh rate, 1440p resolution, and adjustable height. Really, what more could
    I ask for?
	
Mouse: **Logitech G703 Gaming Mouse**
 - The G703 has controllable RGB lighting, has wired/wireless modes, and feels good. It has two buttons on the side,
     which is really all I need. I'm satisfied with it.
	
Keyboard: **WASD V2 87-Key Custom Mechanical Keyboard**
- I actually already had this keyboard before I started this build. If you're considering it, I highly recommend it 
    (check out their V3 keyboard, which came out since I bought mine). I have Cherry MX brown switches, which I 
	absolutely love. They have a decent amount of resistance, so I get to slam down on the keys without breaking
	my keyboard. They put out a new version, V3, which is worth looking into if you're in the market for a new keyboard.
	
Headset: **Senheiser Game ONE**
- This headset has an "open back" design, so you can hear yourself when you talk, which is great. Another upside
    of this is that your ears don't get hot from several hours of use in a row. The only downside that I've
	experienced is that you can hear all of the sounds happening around you. Living on a busy street in NYC
	amplifies this effect, but I think it's worth it compared to having to take the headset off frequently.
	Additionally, the microphone is *amazing*. My friend Sam recommended this headset to me, and his voice sounds like
	he's sitting next to me when we talk online.
