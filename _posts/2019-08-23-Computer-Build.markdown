**Note:** This article is a work-in-progress.

**Warning:** Some parts of this post have far more detail than they probably
need to. Read at your own risk.

## Background
Once I graduated from high school and
started college, I basically stopped playing video games. Going to school and
living with my friends took over, and having a gaming computer at school just
didn't seem worth the effort. Now that I've graduated from college and moved
into my own apartment, I have more time, more freedom, more money, and fewer
social interactions on a day-to-day basis. I decided that I could finally get
back into video games, and I could do it in style.

## Research
Many of my friends have told me about their computer-building
adventures, all of them claiming it's fun, not too hard, and totally worth the
money-for-work trade off (if you build it yourself, you don't have to pay
someone else to do it for you). They weren't wrong, but they led me to believe
that it would be easier and go more smoothly than it did, but more on that
later.

I needed to decide on what parts to buy for my computer. Here are the three
goals I had in mind when choosing the parts:
1. Buy parts that are all compatible with each other, no screw-ups
2. Be able to play games in >100 FPS and 1440p
3. Be able to see the inside of the computer, and (if possible) have it look good

My research mainly consisted of looking up "best X for gaming computers" and
using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) to look at other people's
builds and to sort parts based on various features. In the end, I think I relied
mainly on others' reviews, advice,

To make sure that my goal of part-compatibility was accomplished, I posted on
[/r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc), asking more-experienced people
to review the list of parts that I had come up with. They confirmed that there
were no compatibility issues, as far as they could tell (they were correct), and
that the resulting machine would be a beast – this got my hopes up for goal #2.

## Final parts list
Here is the list of parts that I settled on:

CPU: **AMD Ryzen 7 2700x**
- Why I settled on AMD instead of Intel, I don't really know. I read a lot of
	articles about Intel vs. AMD, and it seemed like the main difference was that
	AMD chips were better at multitasking, whereas Intel chips were better at
	single-threaded tasks. The Ryzen 2700x appealed to me on an aesthetic level,
	it was on sale for Amazon Prime Day, and I saw a 
	[Linus Tech Tips video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoKPCCYvByo) which
	concluded that it was really just as good as whatever the equivalent Intel
	chip is, so I just went for it.

CPU Cooler: **Corsair H100i RGB Platinum SE**
- I saw a build on pcpartpicker.com that I thought looked good that used this
	cooler, so I got it. I did a little research about different coolers, but in
	the end I think I really liked it for the colors.

Motherboard: **ASRock B450M Steel Legend**
- Honestly, none of the motherboards online really piqued my interest. They were
	all pretty meh. There doesn't seem to be one extremely reputable company that
	has everything down. Every other component had at least one candidate that
	made me think to myself "If I can't find anything else, this will work." There
	were no motherboards like that. This one seemed pretty solid according to the
	reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, which, combined with being a microATX board,
	made me pick it over other boards.

Memory: **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro**
- I picked the RAM last, which made this the easiest choice. They were Corsair
	(so they went with my cpu cooler, case, and power supply), they were white,
	and they looked amazing, both on and off. The reviews were also stellar, so
	I jumped on these right away.

Storage: **Samsung 860 EVO SSD 1TB**
- I didn't do too much looking for an SSD. This one was recommended all over the
	place, had great reviews, and wasn't over-the-top expensive. Easy pick.

Video Card: **EVGA GeForce RTX 2080**
- I spent a lot of time deciding what graphics card to get. At one point, I was
	considering getting the RTX 2080 Ti, which is nearly twice as expensive as this one.
	Looking back on it, I am very happy with the card I settled on, as I basically
	don't see how it could perform better than it does, but I'll disucss that in
	more detail in a later section. Anyway, this was the part of the build where
	I decided I wanted my computer to shine unlike any other computer I'd owned
	before. I settled on this card mainly because of the price and the reviews. It
	seemed that the reviews of every graphics card were littered with "Never
	trusting X company again" and "Had to RMA right away," but I figured that was
	a chance I'd need to take no matter what card I bought.

Case: **Corsair Crystal Series 280x**
- This case would accomplish part of one of my goals (be able to see inside the
	computer), it looked really nice, and it was relatively small (I don't have
	much space in my small NYC apartment). My friend Sam has an older version of
	the same case, and gave it a glowing recommendation. All of this was enough to
	make me jump on it.

Power Supply: **Corsair RMx Series RM750x**
- Basically, this PSU looked nice, was fully modular, wasn't overpriced, and had
	good reviews. I stopped looking after I came across this PSU.

## The build
As soon as I got the last part delivered in the mail, I got to building. Looking
back, I should have done much more research about how to *actually build*
a computer. It wasn't a total disaster, but it probably would have gone much
more smoothly if I had watched a person or two complete a build on YouTube.

After I got home from work, I googled "what order to build a PC." I quickly
skimmed through several articles, hoping to get started quickly. One build
suggested that I start by putting the PSU in first, since it's separate from
everything else and it's relatively simple. That was good advice. It was
satisfying to start with something easy, it went in there with no trouble, and
gave me a confidence boost for what was to come. Unfortuntely, not everything
else went so smoothly.

Next, I put the motherboard in the case. I had heard about how fragile the
motherboard can be, so I bought an electrostatic discharge bracelet, which
supposedly protects against frying your parts. I used it, but I'm not sure that
it was actually doing anything. I ended up having to put in and take out the
motherboard several times, but it never got fried, so maybe the bracelet was
working. Initially, it wasn't clear to me where I was supposed to screw the
motherboard in, but eventually I figured it out. The motherboard was easily the
most complicated part of the build – which makes sense as it connects every
piece of your build together.

A lot of the process of building the computer involved goolging stuff about my
specific parts. Everybody online answers questions about motherboards with some
version of "did you read the manual?", which isn't a bad question, but you might as
well answer the question, because it's likely someone else has the same question
who *has* read the manual.

Anyway, after I got the motherboard into the case, I clicked the I/O shield into
place. Another easy win amid the chaos. Next, I went to install the CPU. I saw
on YouTube that you're supposed to gently drop it in and basically do nothing
else. That went fine, but I for some reason I believed that it hadn't gone in
properly, so I removed it and ended up accidentally getting my finger in the
thermal paste. I was kind of concerned that I would need to pause the build
until I got more thermal paste to reapply. The internet reassured me that it
was fine, but if temperatures were higher than normal when the computer was
running that I might need to put more on. It turned out just fine.

Next was the CPU cooler. This part turned out to be one of the more problematic
sections of the build. First off, there were several parts to install. There
were two fans to screw into the radiator, then the radiator-fan combo into the
case, and finally the water block/pump (not sure which it was, might be both?)
onto the CPU. I installed the fans on the inside of the case blowing into the
radiator and out of the case, instead of on the outside of the case blowing into
the radiator and into the case, as the instructions specified. I only realized
this afterwards, but it seems not to have had an impact – or, at least, not
a significantly negative one.

The real problem with the cooler came up when I tried to install the water
block/pump on the CPU. When installing the cooler onto an AMD CPU/motherboard,
you need to hook the water block/pump onto the board. This is most easily done
by unscrewing the parts on the motherboard, raising them, hooking the block on,
and screwing the mobo parts back in. I didn't realize that you could unscrew the
parts on the mobo, so I needed to apply significant force to get the block on
both hooks. **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT DOING THIS.** I was pushing my entire body
down onto the block. I think I got very lucky because nothing was broken, but
I regretted this immediately after doing it. I really wanted everything to
work, so I think I was a little frustrated and lost in the moment. In general,
*if something isn't working by doing it gently, it's probably not supposed to
work like that.* Don't make the same mistake I did (even though nothing bad
happened to me). Read about your parts in detail, watch videos, make sure you
know what you're doing.
