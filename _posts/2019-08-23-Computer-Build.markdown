**NOTE:** This article is a work-in-progress.

## Background
Once I graduated from high school and
started college, I basically stopped playing video games. Going to school and
living with my friends took over, and having a gaming computer at school just
didn't seem worth the effort. Now that I've graduated from college and moved
into my own apartment, I have more time, more freedom, more money, and fewer
social interactions on a day-to-day basis. I decided that I could finally get
back into video games, and I could do it in style.

## Research
Many of my friends have told me about their computer-building
adventures, all of them claiming it's fun, not too hard, and totally worth the
money-for-work trade off (if you build it yourself, you don't have to pay
someone else to do it for you). They weren't wrong, but they led me to believe
that it would be easier and go more smoothly than it did, but more on that
later.

I needed to decide on what parts to buy for my computer. Here are the three
goals I had in mind:
- Buy parts that are all compatible with each other
- Be able to play games in >100 FPS and 1440p
- Be able to see the inside of the computer, and (if possible) have it look good.

## Final parts list
Here is the list of parts that I settled on: **CPU: AMD Ryzen**
7 2700x
- Why I settled on AMD instead of Intel, I don't really know. I read a lot of
	articles about Intel vs. AMD, and it seemed like the main difference was that
	AMD chips were better at multitasking, whereas Intel chips were better at
	single-threaded tasks. The Ryzen 2700x appealed to me on an aesthetic level,
	it was on sale for Amazon Prime Day, and I saw a Linus Tech Tips video which
	concluded that it was really just as good as whatever the equivalent Intel
	chip is, so I just went for it.

CPU Cooler: **Corsair H100i RGB Platinum SE**
- I saw a build on pcpartpicker.com that I thought looked good that used this
	cooler, so I got it. I did a little research about different coolers, but in
	the end I think I really liked it for the colors.

Motherboard: **ASRock B450M Steel Legend**
- Honestly, none of the motherboards online really piqued my interest. They were
	all pretty meh. There doesn't seem to be one extremely reputable company that
	has everything down. Every other component had at least one candidate that
	made me think to myself "If I can't find anything else, this will work." There
	were no motherboards like that. This one seemed pretty solid according to the
	reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, which, combined with being a microATX board,
	made me pick it over other boards.

Memory: **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro**
- I picked the RAM last, which made this the easiest choice. They were Corsair
	(so they went with my cpu cooler, case, and power supply), they were white,
	and they looked amazing, both on and off. The reviews were also stellar, so
	I jumped on these right away.

Storage: **Samsung 860 EVO SSD 1TB**
- I didn't do too much looking for an SSD. This one was recommended all over the
	place, had great reviews, and wasn't over-the-top expensive. Easy pick.

Video Card: **EVGA GeForce RTX 2080**
- I spent a lot of time deciding what graphics card to get. At one point, I was
	considering getting the RTX 2080 Ti, which is nearly twice as expensive.
	Looking back on it, I am very happy with the card I settled on, as I basically
	don't see how it could perform better than it does, but I'll disucss that in
	more detail in a later section. Anyway, this was the part of the build where
	I decided I wanted my computer to shine unlike any other computer I'd owned
	before. I settled on this card mainly because of the price and the reviews. It
	seemed that the reviews of every graphics card were littered with "Never
	trusting X company again" and "Had to RMA right away," but I figured that was
	a chance I'd need to take no matter what card I bought.

Case: **Corsair Crystal Series 280x**
- This case would accomplish part of one of my goals (be able to see inside the
	computer), it looked really nice, and it was relatively small (I don't have
	much space in my small NYC apartment). My friend Sam has an older version of
	the same case, and gave it a glowing recommendation. All of this was enough to
	make me jump on it.

Power Supply: **Corsair RMx Series RM750x**
- Basically, this PSU looked nice, was fully modular, wasn't overpriced, and had
	good reviews. I stopped looking after I came across this PSU.
