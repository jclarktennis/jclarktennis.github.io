&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a link to the project on Github: __[Lyrics Always](https://github.com/jkclark/lyrics-always)__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally used Python with Beautifulsoup to search for song lyrics on [AZLyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/). I later realized I could use [Genius](https://genius.com/)'s API to get the lyrics much more easily. So while Lyrics Always doesn't use BeautifulSoup or web scraping anymore, I did learn a good deal about how it works. I have since used those skills to collect data from the internet, like for my [neural network](https://jkclark.github.com/baseball-neural-net) that predicts the outcomes of baseball games.
