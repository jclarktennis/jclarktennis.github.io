description: Automating finding new music with Reddit and Spotify

---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Friday, new electronic music comes out. I'm not sure if this is a music-industry-wide thing,
or if this is specific to EDM, but I do know that [/r/EDM](reddit.com/r/EDM) has new music every Friday.
So, every Friday, I check /r/EDM for new music. Through my Reddit app on my phone (I'm usually doing this while still in bed after waking up), it takes me four clicks
to get from the post to listening to the linked song. Once I'm done listening, I have to switch
back to the Reddit app (the link took me to the Spotify app) and click back to the listing of posts, which
takes one click. So, to listen to one song, it takes five clicks. If I want to listen to 10 new songs, I normally have
to click 50 times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is annoying. I've decided to write a script that will add certain Spotify links to a playlist, based on post upvotes, song artist, etc.
Once this is done, I can write an user interface to set the frequency with which this happens (music does come out on other days), which subreddits to check,
which artists to look for, etc. Each subreddit/week can have it's own playlist, or you can add to an existing playlist. I've put only a few hours into this,
but I'll keep this blog updated with posts detailing what's going on with the program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is done, I (and you!) will be able to open up Spotify on Friday mornings and listen to all the new songs you want in one playlist.
